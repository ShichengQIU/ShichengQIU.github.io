Biography
======
I'm currently a M.phil student at the Department of Electronic Computer & Engineering (ECE), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of Prof. [Yiwen Wang](https://bmi.hkust.edu.hk/people.html). I received my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2023.

My research interest is broadly on Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) with a focus on high-efficient neural decoding methods.
